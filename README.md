## üìä **Dataset Information**

**Source**: [Kaggle Telco Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

### **Original Features (21)**:
- **Demographics**: Gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents
- **Account Info**: Tenure, Contract, Payment method, Monthly/Total charges
- **Services**: Phone, Internet, Security, Backup, Protection, Support, Streaming
- **Target**: `Churn` (Yes/No)

## Project Highlights

- **Accuracy**: The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of approximately 80%.
- **Top Contributing Features**:
  1. Contract type (Month-to-Month contracts show higher churn rates).
  2. Monthly Charges (Higher charges increase churn likelihood).
  3. Tenure (Short-tenure customers are more prone to churn).

## Visualizations
### Examples:
- **Confusion Matrix**: Evaluates true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
- **Feature Importance**: Highlights the top 10 features influencing customer churn.

## Future Scope
1. Explore advanced models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.
2. Perform hyperparameter tuning for optimized performance.
3. Create an interactive dashboard for business decision-making.
